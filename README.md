## Motivation Timer Summary
An app for Pebble Smartwatches.

Help motivate yourself by setting short timers for tasks, as you do them.  Press any button to start a pre-programmed timer.  After they count down, they buzz until you stop them.

- Down button: "short" (1:30)
- Middle button: "medium" (2:30)
- Up button: "long" (3:30)
- Middle button double-click: stop the buzzing
  - or long-press any button

## Motivation
For certian people this can be a low-stress way of getting motivated.  You can do everything without looking at the watch.  It takes only one button press to start a timer, even when a timer is already running (it cancels the current one).

## Advanced timers
- Down button double-click: "clear mind" (0:45)
- Up button double-click: "think" (0:15)

Try doing a "clear mind" timer followed by a "think" timer (15 seconds of intensive thinking) every now and then.
