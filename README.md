## Motivation Timer Summary
An app for Pebble Smartwatches.

Help motivate yourself by setting short timers for tasks, as you do them.  Press any button to start a pre-programmed timer.  After they count down, they buzz until you stop them.

- Up button: "long" (2:30)
- Middle button: "medium" (1:30)
- Down button: "short" (0:45)

- Middle button double-click: stop the buzzing
  - or long-press any button

## Motivation
For certian people, setting short timers for tasks can be a low-stress way of getting motivated.  You can start and stop timers without looking at the watch.  It takes only one button press to start a timer, even when a timer is already running (it cancels the current one).

## Advanced timers

- Up button double-click: "long" (2:30)
- Down button double-click: "very short" (0:30)

## Tips

Try doing a "short" timer to clear your mind, followed by a "very short" timer (15 seconds of intensive thinking about what your next task could be) to help get started when you're feeling lazy / scatterbrained.
